# kyla_ballerina

This project is an artist page for my daughter. She is a classically trained ballet dancer. The purpose of that page is to allow users, hopefully Company Directors and Ballet Masters,  to get to know more about her professionally throughview photos and videos of the artist. Users are also about to join the "Kyla Ballerina" Fan Club by providing an email address.

I opted to use the CSS Flexbox feature because it seems the most appropriate one to use with a mobile-first design. I also used CSS to apply animation to the banner section. The animation changes the background color. In JavaScript, I made the logo medallion draggable. It's a fun feature that has a lot of room to play around with.
